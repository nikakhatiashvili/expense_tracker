# Expense Tracker

In expense tracker you can manage your money, see real time  cryptocurrency information and exchange rates with currency converter



## Architecture
Architecture MVVM is the design pattern used for making this app. MVVM provides a clear separation of concern and has great support in Android SDK in the form of Architecture Components.


## Libraries Used

Expense tracker uses a number of Libraries to work properly:

- [Hilt] - dependency injector for replacement all Factory classes.
- [navigation] - helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [Splash screen] - This API enables a new app launch animation for all apps when running on a device with Android 12 or higher.
- [Coroutines] - managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
- [Coroutine Flow] - cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception
- [Retrofit] - type-safe HTTP client
- [Glide] - image loading and caching library
- [Firebase] - for authentication and storing user transactions
- [MPAndroidChart] - to chart the financial data
- [ViewModel] - designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
